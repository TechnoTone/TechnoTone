### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tony. AKA TechnoTone.

I discovered computers and programming over 35 years ago and never looked back.

I enjoy listening to podcasts, attending tech meetups, and learning new skills.

My background is mostly with Microsoft and .Net but I have recently discovered the joys of functional programming and am now an aspiring functional programmer. Was lucky to have been able to work with Elm in my previous job and also spent some time looking at Haskell and Rust.

Recently started coaching/mentoring at [codebar.io](https://codebar.io/) and [Exercism](https://exercism.io/).

Not currently looking for new opportunities. Recently joined [Findmypast](https://github.com/findmypast/) and very much enjoying it.
